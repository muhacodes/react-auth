React-Auth with Python-Django Backend," I designed and implemented a secure and user-friendly authentication system for web applications. Leveraging the power of React on the frontend and Python Django on the backend, this project highlights my skills in full-stack web development and user authentication
• Users can easily create accounts and log in securely, thanks to Laravel's robust authentication system
• To enhance security, the server generates and returns authentication tokens upon successful login. These tokens are then used for subsequent requests to protected routes
• User details, including authentication tokens, are stored in the browser's LocalStorage for a seamless user experience. This approach eliminates the need for users to log in repeatedly
• Logged In Users can view their profile, and logout
• The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent and engaging experience across various devices.
